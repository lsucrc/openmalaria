# Open Malaria
This is a containerized distribution of Open Malaria Version 36 by Louisiana State University Coastal Resilience Collaboratory (https://crc.cct.lsu.edu/).

Open Malaria is an open source C++ program for simulating malaria epidemiology and the impacts on that 
epidemiology of interventions against malaria. It is based on microsimulations of Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria in humans, originally developed for simulating malaria vaccines and described here. These models 
simulate the dynamics of malaria parasitaemia in the course of an infection, of transmission, of immunity, 
and of the processes leading to illness and death. The system is set up to simulate malaria in village, 
or district size human populations.
